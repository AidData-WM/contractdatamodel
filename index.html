				<h1>Data Model Comparison - OAP Nepal Pilot Contract Data Model vs. Open Contracting Draft Standard</h1>
				<p>From March-June, 2013, Development Gateway, the Open Aid Partnership, and the Government of Nepal worked on a pilot exercise to collect and code procurement data. The goal of that exercise was to see the degree to which open procurement data could provide operationally-relevant information on development activities, with the view of aiding planners and policy makers better understand patterns of spending in their sectors/countries.</p>
				<p>This webpage is meant as a rough working document to help undertake an open comparison between the Draft Open Contracting data model and the data model used in the Nepal pilot. This is not meant as a formal publication of the Open Aid Partnership, the Government of Nepal, or Development Gateway. For any questions about this webpage, or to request more formal documentation on the pilot, please contact Owen Scott at &lt oscott (at) developmentgateway.org. &gt </p>
				<h2>The Data Models</h2>
				<h3>Open Contracting Draft Standard</h3>
				<p>Taken from the <a href="https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike">OC-Datamerge Spike</a>. Note that this is a draft standard developed during a work spike, and is meant only as a starting place for discussion.
				<div id="draftStandard"></div>
				<h3>Nepal Pilot Data Model</h3>
				<p>This is the data model used during the Nepal pilot. There are some minor inconsistencies due to the fact that the data were actually collected into a relational database, but this captures the general idea.</p>

        <h2>Comparison of Data Models</h2>
				<p>This section uses the visualizations from the <a href="https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike">OC-Datamerge Spike github repo</a> to cross-compare the data models from the Nepal Pilot and the Draft Open Contracting Data Model.</p>
