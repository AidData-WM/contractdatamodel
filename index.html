					<h1>Data Model Comparison - OAP Nepal Pilot Contract Data Model vs. Open Contracting Draft Standard</h1>
					<p>From March-June, 2013, Development Gateway, the Open Aid Partnership, and the Government of Nepal worked on a pilot exercise to collect and code procurement data in Nepal. The goal of that exercise was to see the degree to which open procurement data could provide operationally-relevant information on development activities, with the view of aiding planners and policy makers to better understand patterns of spending in their sectors/countries.</p>
					<p>Public information on procurement was obtained from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Nepalâ€™s Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads. The DG team focused the pilot on four primary sectors: Water and Sanitation, Transportation, Energy, and Education. Documents for 38 unique projects were collected for the pilot, resulting in 435 individual contracts and tender awards. Geographic information for these procurement documents was also coded, allowing the procurement data to be mapped to specific point locations.</p>
					<p>This webpage is meant as a rough working document to help undertake an open comparison between the Draft Open Contracting data model and the data model used in the Nepal pilot. This is not meant as a formal publication of the Open Aid Partnership, the Government of Nepal, or Development Gateway. For any questions about this webpage, or to request more formal documentation on the pilot, please contact Owen Scott at &ltoscott (at) developmentgateway.org. &gt</p>
					<h2>The Data Models</h2>
					<h3>Open Contracting Draft Standard</h3>
					<p>The data model below was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike">OC-Datamerge Spike</a> (along with the visualization). Note that this is a draft standard developed during a work spike, and is meant only as a starting place for discussion.
					<div id="draftStandard" ></div>
					<h3>Nepal Pilot Data Model</h3>
					<p>This is the data model used during the Nepal pilot. There are some minor inconsistencies due to the fact that the data were actually collected into a relational database, but this captures the general idea.</p>
					<div id="pilotModel" ></div>
					<h2>Comparison of Data Models</h2>
					<p>This section uses the visualizations forked from the <a href="https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike">OC-Datamerge Spike github repo</a> to cross-compare the data models from the Nepal Pilot and the Draft Open Contracting Data Model. The name of each field is visible on mouse-over (works best in Firefox).</p>
