        <h1>Draft Standard Investigation Report</h1>
        <h3>Welcome to the Open Contracting Data Spike</h3>

        <p>The objective was to spend 5 days exploring the feasibility of
        developing a common standard for open contracting data and scoping the
        opportunities and challenges.</p>

        <p>This work was "supply-side" only, meaning that it looked at a number of
        available data sets to examine the problem rather than looking at the
        "demand-side" - what information do stakeholders want.</p>

        <p>In addition to examining feasibility, opportunities and challenges, a
        draft standard was produced in order to provide something on paper for
        people to engage with - the draft included here is in no way an
        accepted or agreed standard, mearly a talking point.</p>

        <p>This work was presented at the ODI with
        <a href="http://www.open-contracting.org/">http://www.open-contracting.org/</a> on March 28th 2013.</p>

        <p>The following data was looked at during this project:

        <ul><li>UK Contracts Finder - <a href="https://online.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/">https://online.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/</a></li>
            <li>Philippines - <a href="http://www.philgeps.gov.ph">http://www.philgeps.gov.ph</a></li>
        <li>USA Spending - <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/">http://www.usaspending.gov/</a></li>
        <li>Colombia - https://www.contratos.gov.co/consultas/inicioConsulta.do</li>
        <li>World Bank - https://finances.worldbank.org/Procurement/Major-Contract-Awards/kdui-wcs3?</li>
        <li>Guinea - http://www.contratsminiersguinee.org/</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>The Guinea data was not used in the mapping as it was too disparate to
        facilitate the process that we were trying to do. However, bringing in
        extractive industry and other such disparate data will be an important
        part of future work. The US data was only partially looked at,
        specifically to look at the transaction data available.</p>

        <h3>Detail</h3>
        <p>Here we look at which fields each dataset contains. The blue squares are where a proposed field
        is already available in the existing data and the orange squares are those fields that are available
        in the dataset, but are not used in the proposed standard.</p>
